Manuscript Data - Gaudreault et al., 2022 - Sleep Spindle Frequency and White Matter Fiber Lengths
Project Name: Sloop

## What is inside this repo?
This repository contains data to reprodruce the main results and figures of the manuscript Gaudreault et al., 2022 entitled "The length of the thalamo-cortical white matter fibers brings insight into sex differences in sleep spindle frequency"

## What is inside the CSV file?

- Our subjects are identified from Subj 1 to Subj 30
- The column "Gender" refers of each subjects. 1= man, 2= woman
- Intracranial volume (ICV) are in liters (l)

- Sleep spindles characteristics are presented as amplitude or frequency on F3, F4, C3, and C4 electrodes
- White matter fiber bundles are presented as "1/median length" for the five bilateral regions of interests: caudal anterior cingulate (CAC), rostral middle frontal (RMF), Anterior superior frontal (SFa), middle superior frontal (SFm), and posterior superior frontal (SFp).

- All statistical analyses were carried out on SPSS.
